# Long-Tail Perfume-Recommendation-System

## Project Overview

#### Purpose
The aim of the project is to leverage sophisticated text analysis and machine learning techniques to curate and suggest unique perfume selections for niche markets with specific preferences.

#### Problem Statement
- Enhance shopping experience by minimizing choice overload and discovering high-quality,
unique products
- Empower small to medium fragrance business owners to elevate the value of their underrated
products
- Assist perfume enthusiasts in exploring affordable fragrances while discovering new scents

## Methodology
Initially, we extracted perfume reviews through web scraping. We then selected long-tail perfumes with proven quality, indicated by overall ratings exceeding 4.5 out of 5. Based on the scent descriptions and the review texts, we calculated a comprehensive evaluation score for each review. This was achieved by multiplying the similarity and sentiment scores derived from the reviews against a simulated user profile detailing scent preferences, usage occasions, and price range. Finally, employing a Word2Vec model, our recommendation system generated a list of high-scoring long-tail perfumes.
