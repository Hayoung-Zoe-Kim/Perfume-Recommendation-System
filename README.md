# Long-Tail Perfume-Recommendation-System

## Project Overview

#### Purpose
The aim of the project is to leverage sophisticated text analysis and machine learning techniques to curate and suggest unique perfume selections for niche markets with specific preferences.

#### Problem Statement
- Enhance shopping experience by minimizing choice overload and discovering high-quality,
unique products
- Empower small to medium fragrance business owners to elevate the value of their underrated
products
- Assist perfume enthusiasts in exploring affordable fragrances while discovering new scents

## Methodology
Initially, we extracted perfume reviews through web scraping. We then selected long-tail perfumes with proven quality, indicated by overall ratings exceeding 4.5 out of 5. Based on the scent descriptions and the review texts, we calculated a comprehensive evaluation score for each review. This was achieved by multiplying the similarity and sentiment scores derived from the reviews against a simulated user profile detailing scent preferences, usage occasions, and price range. Finally, employing a Word2Vec model, our recommendation system generated a list of high-scoring long-tail perfumes.

#### Data Source & Preprocessing

## Conclusion
- The Word2Vec model facilitated a nuanced understanding of user preferences, connecting scent descriptions and review texts with user sentiments to create a personalized recommendation experience.
  
- The dual-phase approach of the project shed light on a compelling aspect of the fragrance market: While the allure of obscure brands is undeniable for certain attributes, it is remarkable to observe that many affordable yet desirable perfumes originate from well-known houses. This suggests a complex interplay between brand perception and product quality, highlighting an opportunity for small to medium fragrance businesses to capitalize on their unique offerings.

- The value of our Long-Tail Perfume Recommendation System is that by bridging the gap between accessibility and exploration, it stands as a beacon for discovery in the vast ocean of fragrances, guiding consumers to their perfect scent match while supporting the growth of diverse perfume brands.
